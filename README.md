# OpenCV + Python3

In this repository I'll store some codes that are developed while learning both Python 3 and OpenCV through `Learning OpenCV 4 Computer Vision with Python 3` book.

My development environment:

* Ubuntu 20.04
* Python 3.8.5

## Installation

```shell
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install python3-numpy python3-scipy
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
